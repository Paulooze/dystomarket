        About Dystomarket
      </h2>
      <p className="my-4">
        In a world where megacorporations rule the economy and market
        manipulation is just another Tuesday, Dystomarket is your ultimate
        window into the corporate dystopia of tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Here, stock prices shift on whispers, hostile takeovers are the norm,
        and the line between innovation and exploitation blurs into neon-lit
        oblivion. Track the rise and fall of fictional giants, from shadowy
        defense contractors to soulless tech conglomerates, all vying for
        dominance in an economy where ethics are just a rounding error.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Whether you&apos;re a high-frequency trader playing the system or just
        another cyber-street speculator watching the world burn, Dystomarket
        gives you the real-time pulse of capitalismâ€™s final form.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">Stay informed. Stay ahead. Or get left behind.</p>
